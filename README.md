# ![SAGE](docs/img/sage-logo.png)

A modular LLM chatbot UI for OPACA platforms with multi-agent orchestration and tool calling.

## ❓ What is SAGE?

SAGE, also referred to as the 'OPACA LLM UI', is a powerful chatbot that can fulfill user requests by calling actions from a connected [OPACA platform](https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-core). It can be easily extended with additional agents, developed in any programming language. Multiple reference implementations can be found in the [opaca-example-containers](https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-example-containers) repository. Further, the repository for our python package [opaca](https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-python-sdk) includes a detailed step-by-step guide on how to develop and deploy new agents very easily using Python.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Docker (recommended)

##### 1. Create a new .env file by copying the example

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

##### 2. Configure (`.env`)

```bash
URL="http://<YOUR_IP>"                     # For example "http://192.168.1.100"
PUBLIC_URL="${URL}:8000"
VITE_PLATFORM_URL="${PUBLIC_URL}"
VITE_BACKEND_URL="${URL}:3001"
CORS_WHITELIST="${URL}:5173"
```

##### 3. Start SAGE using Docker

```bash
docker compose --profile platform up --build
```

The `--profile platform` flag will automatically start and configure an OPACA platform SAGE can connect to.

### Native

#### Backend

```bash
# Change into the backend directory
cd Backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python -m src.server
```

#### Frontend

```bash
# Change into the frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend
npm run host
```

#### OPACA Platform

Please refer to the [OPACA documentation](https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-core) for more information on how to set up your own OPACA platform.

## ✨ Features

### OPACA Agent Actions

SAGE can connect to a running [OPACA platform](https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-core) and call actions from agent containers. Actions are internally transformed into _tools_ and passed to an LLM, which then returns tool calls including their names and parameters. All generated tools/actions are then invoked via the OPACA platform. 

### Internal Tools

Alongside the OPACA agent actions, SAGE defines a few internal tools that can be used to perform core tasks. These include:

* `ScheduleIntervalTask`: Schedules a task to be executed with a given delay and a specified amount of repititions.
* `ScheduleDailyTask`: Schedules a daily task to be executed at a given time.
* `GetScheduledTasks`: Returns a list of all scheduled tasks, yet to be executed.
* `CancelScheduledTask`: Cancels a scheduled task.
* `GatherUserInfo`: Compiles a short summary of the user (session) based on all existing conversations.
* `SearchChats`: Searches all conversations for a given query.
* `ReadFileFromUrl`: Downloads a file from a given URL and uses it as input for the LLM.

### Method Configuration

Multiple task-solving [methods](docs/methods_overview.md) have been implemented in SAGE. Each method can be selected and configured using the [UI](docs/ui.md). Especially, each LLM component can be configured to a different model, even a locally running model. This allows for a more flexible and customizable approach to task-solving.

### Container Login

Some agent containers provide function which can only be called when authenticated, for example the Exchange Agent or Gitlab Agent available in the [opaca-example-containers](https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-example-containers) repository. When called, these functions will prompt a login window to enter credentials for the specific service. Credentials are then sent via the platform to the agent container, which will use them to authenticate the request user. Please note that entered credentials are **never** stored in SAGE or the OPACA platform, and that after the first successful login, tokens are generated to authenticate the user instead and sent in the header for each subsequent request to that container. However, please note that the credentials will also be sent to the agent container for authentication, so only add trusted containers to your platform environment.

Also be aware that tokens are bound to an **OPACA user**, not to a session. This means that if you are running your OPACA platform with authentication disabled, ALL sessions will share their container login tokens. To enable platform authentication, see the [Authentication](#-authentication) section below.

### Speech I/O

The chatbot-UI supports speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) using either the builtin WebSpeech functions of e.g. the Google Chrome browser, or OpenAI's Whisper model. Accordant proxy-routes are included in the backend. Also, in any case TTS and STT will only work if the frontend is using HTTPS or running on the same host (i.e. localhost).

### Sample Prompts

When you start SAGE, you will notice a set of sample prompts that give an overview of the capabilities of SAGE. These prompts may only work if specific agents are available in the connected OPACA platform. Users are free to modify them to their liking and admins can change the default prompts.

### File Handling

Currently, SAGE can support the following file types as input:

* PDFs: `.pdf`
* Images: `.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp`,

Files can be added to a conversation by either adding them via the "Upload File" button in the chat input section or by dragging them into the screen. Files are first uploaded to the SAGE backend and then to the individual selected models in the method configuration upon querying. Including files cross conversations can be toggled in the File-Sidebar. Please note that not all models support file uploads.

## 🔒 Authentication

The OPACA platform that SAGE is connected to can be protected using authentication. To enable authentication on the OPACA platform, set the following environment variables in your `.env` file or directly in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file under the `opaca-platform` service:

```bash
REQUIRE_AUTH=true
SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
PLATFORM_ADMIN_USER=<YOUR_ADMIN_USER>
PLATFORM_ADMIN_PWD=<YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
```

Then start SAGE using the `platform` profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile platform up --build
```

When you then try to connect to the platform with SAGE, you will be prompted to enter your credentials.

An admin can further create additional users for SAGE by using the OPACA platform's Swagger-UI, usually available under http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui/index.html.
