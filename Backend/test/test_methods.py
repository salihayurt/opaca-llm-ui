"""
The purpose of these tests is NOT to measure how fast or overall "good" the LLM
is. That's what the Benchmarks are for. These tests are much more simple: Just
to see whether it all works. Whether tools are called (any tools, really),
whether the LLM has access to the message history, whether there are any other
unexpected errors, and whether all the other non-LLM routes work.

How to test:
- start OPACA Runtime Platform (RP)
- Deploy the Smart office container to it (rkader2811/smart-office)
- set the environment variable VITE_PLATFORM_URL to the URL of the RP
- run "python -m test" from /Backend to run all tests

Note:
- all method or classes that start with "test" are considered tests
- tests are executed in order and may depend on each others
- subsequent tests are executed even if earlier tests failed
- print is only shown on failed tests
- if the URL is not set, the tests are skipped
