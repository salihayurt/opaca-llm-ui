# User Interface

![SAGE UI Screenshot](img/sage-ui.png)

The web UI is implemented in Javascript using Node and Vue. 

## Main Chat Window

The main chat window shows the messages in the current interaction and an input field for submitting messages. The LLM's output is interpreted and formatted as Markdown, allowing for text formatting, code snippets, and embedded images (the LLM itself an not generate images, but it can display images if e.g. the URL to an image was returned from an action). Initially, the chat window shows a selection of example prompts that can be used.

Below the chat output is the input prompt. Clicking on the "send" button or pressing Enter will submit the query to the LLM. The UI also allows for speech input and output using the microphone button. If the last message was spoken, the response will automatically be read out aloud. It is also possible to upload files (e.g. PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF) to be taken into account in the next LLM queries. Finally, the "reset" button can be used to clear the chat history. Note that the full history is stored in a Session Cookie.

Each response by the LLM includes additional "debug" output that can be expanded by clicking on the "debug" button below the message. Also, the messages can be read aloud using text-to-speech by clicking another button. Before the LLM's final response is ready, the "thinking process" is streamed to the UI (this may vary depending on the prompting method being used).

## Sidebar

A collapsible sidebar providing different sections for configuring the OPACA Runtime Platform to connect to, browsing the list of available agents and actions, configuring details of the used LLM Backend, and showing additional debug output.

* **Info**: When connected to an OPACA platform, shows a short LLM-generated summary of the agents and actions being available.
* **Chats**: List of currently active chats. Can be used to re-visit an old chat session and continue where you left off, or to create a new chat with fresh history.
* **Files**: List of files (e.g. PDF documents and images) that have been uploaded to the LLM for e.g. description, summarization, or to provide additional background information on e.g. company-internal processes and regulations. Once uploaded, individual PDFs and images can be activated or deactivated for the current chat interaction.
* **Prompt Library**: A list of example prompts, grouped into different categories. The default prompts are tailored for our current internal demonstration deployment, but each user can curate their own. The default selection can be edited by admins. Clicking an example prompt will automatically send it to the LLM. Clicking "Suggest more" at the bottom will prompt the LLM to come up with new sample queries based on the available actions on its own.  Prompts can contain placeholder values in square brackets, e.g. "Get the weather in [city]".
* **Agents & Actions**: Shows the list of all Containers, Agents and their respective Actions currently available on the connected OPACA Runtime Platform. Each Container can be expanded to show its Agents, and each Agent can be expanded to show its Actions, which can be further expanded to show their parameters and a short description. Actions can also be invoked directly from this list, bypassing the LLM, by using the "Execute" button. If the user has sufficient privileges (role "contributor" or higher), OPACA Agent Containers can also be deployed directly from within the Agents view, including their container parameters, using either the image name, JSON, or by selecting them from an OPACA Image Registry.
* **Extensions**: Lists task-specific web-UIs provided by currently running OPACA Agent Containers via their `extraPorts` attribute. UIs can be shown in a small preview or as an expanded overlay.
* **MCP Servers**: Provides a possibility to add MCP servers to SAGE. All added MCP Servers will be listed here. MCP Servers are added per session.
* **Configuration**: Allows to send different configurations to the backend, depending on the selected prompting method, e.g. for which LLM to use at what temperature.
* **Logging**: Shows the full logging-information sent by the AI-agents in the backend; this is the same as shown underneath the individual messages, but all in one place. Also, other than the output underneath the message, the logging output in this section is streamed as the LLM is still "thinking", making it a valuable resource for requests that take more time.
* **About/FAQ**: Shows some information about the general workings of SAGE.


## Header

Used to connect to an OPACA Runtime Platform, including authentication, if necessary. Note that if SAGE is running in Docker-Compose, you will have to provide your own IP address here (e.g. taken from `ifconfig`), as "localhost" will not work in this case. For easier startup, the default-URL can be passed as an environment variable, and the `?autoconnect` query parameter can be used to automatically connect to it.

The Navigation/Header bar also contains a dropdown that can be used to e.g. set the language of the UI (this does not influence the language of the LLM, which will just react to the language it is spoken to), and most importantly a selector for the [method](methods_overview.md) to be used for interacting with the actual LLM. You can also select different color themes here (by default, the UI adapts to the system theme, either light or dark).


## Extensions

The Extensions area in the sidebar allows to embed task-specific web-UIs provided by currently running OPACA Agent Containers via their `extraPorts` attribute. Those could be e.g. a simple task-list for a task-management container, a live-updated overview of different sensor readings, or similar. The UIs are embedded as IFrames, either as a small preview directly in the sidebar, or expanded to near-fullscreen size in an overlay.

Note: At the moment, the Extensions sidebar itself does not provide means for Container Login on it's own. If an extension requires container-login (e.g. in the above task-list example), container-login has to be triggered by requesting a service from that container first. After that, the container-token will be included as a query parameter in the IFrame.


## Configuration

Several aspects of the UI, such as the available and default prompting method, the selection of sample prompts, or the default language can be configured in `config.ts`. Several of those can also be configured via environment variables, e.g. in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
